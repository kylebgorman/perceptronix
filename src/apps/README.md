This directory contains sample applications of linear models to NLP problems.
All applications here:

* Support (indeed, require) training from labeled examples
* Support model (de)serialization using protocol buffers

Included or planned applications include:

* POS tagger: `pos_tagger`
* Sentence tokenizer: `sentence_tokenizer`
* Case restorer: `case_restorer`
* Word tokenizer: `word_tokenizer`

As of 2016-10-08 only the first two are fully functional.
