This directory contains sample applications of linear models to NLP problems. All applications here:

* Support (indeed, require) training from labeled examples
* Support model serialization using Perceptronix protocol buffers

Included or planned applications include:

* Sentence tokenizer: `sentence_tokenizer`
* Truecaser: `truecaser`
* Word tokenizer: `word_tokenizer`

As of 2016-09-17 only the sentence tokenizer is fully functional.
